This code calculates the total surface area of a 3D structure made from stacked unit cubes arranged on a grid, where each cell of the grid (matrix `A`) specifies how many cubes are stacked at that position. The algorithm works by iterating over every cell of the grid, and for each cell with one or more cubes, it adds two units of area for the top and bottom faces, since these are always exposed unless the cell has zero cubes. For each of the four sides up, down, left, and right—the code determines how much of that side is exposed by subtracting the neighboring cell’s stack height from the current cell’s height (or assuming zero if the neighbor lies beyond the grid border), and adding the resulting difference to the total area only if it is positive. This way, the area covered by adjacent blocks is not double-counted, and only the truly exposed portions of each cube contribute to the surface area. After processing all grid cells and summing up their contributions, the algorithm returns the total exposed surface area of the combined structure. The code reads input data using standard input, constructs the grid of cube heights, and then outputs the result for use in coding challenges or technical assessments, ensuring correctness while handling both inner and border cells.
